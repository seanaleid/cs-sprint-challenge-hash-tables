# Intersections of Multiple Lists

Find the intersection between multiple lists of integers.

Do not use numpy or sets to solve this; use `dict` or hashtables,
please.

We're given a list of lists that contain integers:

```python
[
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [12, 7, 2, 9, 1],
    [99, 2, 7, 1,]
]
```

And we need to compute the _intersection_, that is, numbers that exist
in all lists.

From the above input, the return value will be:

```
[1, 2]
```

Because those are the numbers that exist in all the lists.

(Output can be in any order.)

Limits:

* There can be up to 10 lists in the list of lists.
* The lists can contain up to roughly 1,000,000 elements each.

* U --> Return only the numbers that can be found in all lists. Order doesn't matter
* P --> 
    # 1. Loop over array in arrays
        # Loop over num in array
            # Check if num is in the dict
                # Yes
                    # Check if in the result array, to prevent multiples of the same num in the result
                        # Yes, then pass
                        # No, append to result list
                # No, add to dict
    # 2. Return result list
* E --> âœ…
* R --> For this problem and test, only looking for 1 instance of the repeated number, not duplicates, need to check if num already in teh result. Is this the fastest/most optimized way? Maybe?
